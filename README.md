# Lib4RI RDM Services Sunburst Visualization

This is an interactive D3.js sunburst diagram showcasing the Research Data Management (RDM) services offered by Lib4RI and the four research institutes within the ETH Domain: Eawag, Empa, PSI, and WSL.

This radial space-filling visualization was originally created by [John Stasko]{https://sites.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/ii/sunburst/} and traditionally shows the [cumulative values of subtrees]{https://eurostat.github.io/d3.sunburst/}. It is commonly used to visualize nested objects, in large part becuase it shows the mass of hidden things in each subsection.

## Overview

This visualization provides a hierarchical view of the RDM services and tools available across the institutes, aligned with the research data lifecycle phases:

* **Plan**: Data Management Plans (DMPs), FAIR principles
* **Collect**: Data acquisition, formats, and metadata
* **Process & Analyze**: Data processing, analysis tools
* **Preserve & Share**: Data storage, repositories, publication
* **Find & Reuse**: Data discovery, reuse, and citation.

Each segment of the sunburst represents a specific service or tool, allowing users to explore the interconnectedness and offerings within each phase.
