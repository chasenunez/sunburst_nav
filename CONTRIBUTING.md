# Contributing to Sunburst Navigation Tools

Thank you for considering contributing to the navigation tool! I welcome contributions from the community and appreciate your interest in improving this project. By participating, you agree to adhere to the guidelines below.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the navigation tool, whether by fixing bugs, improving the documentation, or adding new features. Please follow these steps to make a contribution:

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your GitHub/lab account. This creates a copy of the project where you can freely make changes without affecting the main project.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Clone your fork to your local machine to begin working on it:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.eawag.ch/chase.nunez/rdm_nav.git
cd rdm_nav
```

### 3. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your changes. Try to make the branch name descriptive of the changes you're making.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Make Changes

Make your changes locally in the repository. Be sure to follow any code style guidelines (e.g., PEP8 for Python, Airbnb for JavaScript) and include tests if applicable.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

After making your changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message. Try to follow the convention of "What" and "Why" in your commit message.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature that does X"
```

### 6. Push Your Changes

Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Go to the original repository on GitHub and open a pull request to merge your changes into the `main` branch. Be sure to include a description of the changes you've made, the problem they solve, and any additional context that may be helpful for the reviewer.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please check the [Issues](https://gitlab.eawag.ch/chase.nunez/rdm_nav/-/issues) section to see if it's already reported. If not, create a new issue and include the following details:

* A descriptive title.
* A clear and concise description of the problem or feature request.
* Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
* Expected vs. actual behavior.
* Any relevant screenshots or logs.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your pull request is related to an open issue (e.g., "Fixes #123").
2. Your PR should include only related commits—please don’t mix unrelated changes in one PR.
3. Add appropriate tests (if applicable).
4. Ensure all tests pass (check the status of the CI/CD builds).
5. Make sure the code follows the project's code style.

I’ll review your pull request and get back to you with feedback as soon as possible. I may request changes before merging.
